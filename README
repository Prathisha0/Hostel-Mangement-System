A **Hostel Management System** is a software project designed to manage hostel operations efficiently. It includes **student registration, room allocation, fee management, attendance tracking, and complaint handling**. The system typically has **Admin, Student, and Warden** roles. The **Admin** manages rooms, fees, and student records, while **Students** can check room availability and pay fees. A database (MySQL, SQLite) stores records, and the interface can be built using **Java (Swing/JavaFX), Python (Tkinter), or Web (HTML, PHP, MySQL)**. The project simplifies hostel administration, reduces paperwork, and ensures transparency in hostel operations, making management easier and more organized.
